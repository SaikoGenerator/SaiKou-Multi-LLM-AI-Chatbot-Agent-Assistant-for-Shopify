## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the SaiKou agent running on your development store.

### Prerequisites

- A Shopify Partner account and a development store.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18.20 or higher).
- The [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd SaiKou-Multi-LLM-AI-Chatbot-Agent-Assistant-for-Shopify
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Connect to your Shopify store:**
    The Shopify CLI will prompt you to log in and select your organization and store.
    ```bash
    npm run config:link
    ```

4.  **Create your environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    You will need to fill in the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` and `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` which are provided after running `npm run config:link`. You also need to ensure the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set. The other keys can be left blank as we will configure them in the admin UI.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the app and provide you with a URL to install it on your development store. Open the URL and follow the prompts to install the app.

## üîß Configuration

Once the app is installed, you can configure your AI provider through the admin dashboard:

1.  In your Shopify Admin, go to **Apps** and open the **SaiKou Chatbot** app.
2.  Navigate to the **Settings** page using the top navigation menu.
3.  From the dropdown, select your desired **LLM Provider** (e.g., Gemini).
4.  Enter your **API Key** for that provider in the password field.
5.  Click **Save**.

The chat agent on your storefront will now be powered by your selected provider!

*Note: The app can also be configured using environment variables as a fallback. See the `.env.example` file for more details.*
