# Progress Report - August 29, 2025

This document summarizes the work completed on the Shopify AI Chat Agent.

## Feature 1: Multi-LLM Provider Support

The application has been refactored to support multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers, allowing for greater flexibility and choice of AI models.

### Key Changes:
- **Dynamic LLM Service Factory:** Created a new service at `app/services/llm.server.js` that dynamically selects the LLM provider based on configuration.
- **Provider-Specific Services:** Implemented individual services for the following providers in the `app/services/providers/` directory:
    - Claude (existing, refactored)
    - OpenAI
    - Google Gemini
    - Groq
    - OpenRouter
- **Full Implementation:** Each provider service includes complete logic for handling streaming responses and tool/function calls.
- **Configuration:** Updated `.env.example` to include API keys for all supported providers and a variable to set the default provider.

## Feature 2: Admin UI for LLM Settings

A new settings page has been added to the Shopify admin interface, allowing merchants to configure their LLM provider and API keys without needing to modify environment files.

### Key Changes:
- **New Admin Route:** Created a new settings page at `/app/settings`.
- **Database Integration:**
    - Added a `ShopSettings` table to the database schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) to store per-shop configurations.
    - Implemented a secure settings service (`app/services/settings.server.js`) to manage these settings.
- **API Key Security:** All API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before being stored in the database. A new `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable is required for this.
- **Polaris UI:** The settings page is built with Shopify's Polaris design system for a seamless merchant experience.
- **Shop-Aware Logic:** The chat agent is now "shop-aware." It fetches the configuration for the specific shop making the request from the database. If no settings are found for that shop, it falls back to the global settings defined in the environment variables.

## Next Steps

The following providers from the original request have not yet been implemented:
- Xai Grok
- Huggingface

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for adding these or any other future providers.
